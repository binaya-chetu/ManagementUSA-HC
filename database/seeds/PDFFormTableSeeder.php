                                            Liability Waiver and Hold Harmless: I voluntarily choose to undergo hormone replacement therapy. All potential risks and side effects have been fully explained to me. I acknowledge and understand those risks. I have assessed the risk on a personal basis, and my personal belief is the benefits of hormone therapy outweighs the risks (including the possibility of raised prostate levels which some physicians think could possibly lead to prostate cancer). I hereby release and agrees to hold harmless Oklahoma Men’s Clinic, the entire Staff at Oklahoma Men’s Clinic and the prescribing Physician associated with my hormone replacement therapy. I have had adequate time to consider all options and research hormone replacement therapies.

                                            Using Shockwaves in strategic locations of the penis and then injecting PFRM with Stem Cells. Until the introduction of shockwave therapy, all existing treatment options for erectile dysfunction are palliative in nature. This means that instead of correcting the underlying problem, existing treatments only treat symptoms on an episodic basis. Common treatments for erectile dysfunction are phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, Staxyn, and Stendra), injections and/or suppositories, and vacuum compression. Oklahoma Men’s Clinic has established a non-surgical protocol for treating erectile dysfunction with shockwave therapy and combining it with PRFM (Platelet Rich Plasma Fibrin Matrix) and Stem Cell Therapy. The therapies have shown excellent outcomes with little or no side effects and long lasting results. Shockwave therapy has also shown to be a successful treatment option for Pyrone’s disease.

                                            At Oklahoma Men’s Clinic we believe in treating the underlying issue with regenerative medicine. Shockwave therapy has been widely used in orthopedic medicine to regenerate tissue. This same therapy can be applied to treat men with erectile dysfunction. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, such as pills or injections, though effective, lose effectiveness over time and have to be used every time a man wants to engage in sexual activity. This treatment is about regenerative medicine to help men return to their younger, healthier selves and enabling a spontaneous, active sex life. The shockwaves create micro trauma to the tissue, stimulating the body’s natural healing response. As the body heals, blood flow is increased and growth factors create new blood vessels to the treated area. Shockwave therapy is combined with PRFM (Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix) and new stem cells, which adds a high concentration of growth factors to work synergistically together. The PFRM treatment is natural in that your own cells are used, treated with a chemical that is not foreign to the body and injected into the specified areas. Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cells as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with up to 10%-20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of up to 1 inch in girth and length is common.

                                            There’s actual growth of new tissue by stimulation of uni-potent stem cells including the new stem cells which were injected, so the change in shape is not from something foreign being in the body but from the body actually rejuvenating and growing. The PRFM stimulates new blood flow with the new blood vessels (neovascularization).

                                            The results of this treatment should be indefinite based on the individual and his lifestyle choices but results may vary and research documenting the longevity or results are ongoing.

                                            A summary of possible results includes: immediately larger penis; strengthening of the penis, straightening of the penis, increased circulation within the penis for a healthier organ, increased effectiveness of other therapies (if you use Viagra, Cialis, etc it will work better for you), an increase in sensation and pleasure (helps correct the damage from diabetes), increased size by design (can place more in the base or in the head or wherever makes for best result), no allergic reactions (due to using your won bodily fluids), no lumpiness, and minimal pain (no burning from the PRFM since it’s from your own body).

                                            1. A series of 6 shockwaves (EPAT) treatments are administered (Two per week for 3 consecutive weeks).
                                            2. A numbing lidocaine cream is applied to the penis prior to the procedure.
                                            3. On the fifth treatment approximately 20cc (about 4 tablespoons) of blood are drawn in the same way blood samples are taken for routine lab tests. The tubes of blood are centrifuged to separate the component cells. Platelets are separated and used for this procedure. The platelets are treated with calcium chloride (which tricks the cells into thinking that they are in the body and the body has been injured). The platelets release growth factors into the liquid of the tube. Stem cells are then added to the PRFM. The liquid is transferred into a syringe and strategically injected into the penis using a long slim needle and this process is used to distribute the growth factors and increase their effectiveness.

Patient agrees to respond truthfully, accurately, and completely on the MHF and acknowledges that failure to provide truthful, accurate, and complete information on the MHF or to the Medical Provider(s) at Oklahoma Men’s Clinic (“Provider”) could result in inappropriate treatment. Patient authorizes Oklahoma Men’s Clinic to receive copies of reports from medical laboratories, diagnostic testing services and dispensing pharmacies relating to his/her treatment. In addition, patient authorizes and instructs Oklahoma Men’s Clinic, Medical Provider(s) and dispensing pharmacies obtained on my behalf to provide medical care and prescribed pharmaceuticals based on the information contained on the MHF, laboratory diagnostic tests, and other information submitted to Oklahoma Men’s Clinic under the Agreement. Patient agrees to present photo identification upon receiving any blood testing pursuant to an Oklahoma Men’s Clinic or Provider test requisition.

                                            <strong>Erectile Dysfunction & Premature Ejaculation:</strong> The Medical Provider(s) will perform some diagnostic tests. The first test is a Vascular Doppler Diagnostic. This test measures the blood flow through the penis. The doctor will locate the cavernosal artery in the penis and measure “passive” blood flow (when you are not sexually excited). The Medical Provider will then apply a test dose of medication designed for your specific problem to the spongy tissue of the penis using an auto-applicator. The test dose of medication contains a combination of commonly use vasodilators including Papaverine, Phentolamine and Prostaglandin E1. This medication will dilate the arteries so that the “active” blood flow (as when you are sexually excited) through the penis can be measured. A partial or full erection lasting 40-60 minutes usually results from this application. Other rare effects of this procedure include some mild discomfort or light-headedness mostly due to nervousness. This reaction is generally normal. Rarely, this application may produce a full erection lasting longer than two hours. Such prolonged erection is unusual and only occurs in those who are overly sensitive to the combination used. Should this possibility occur, you will be advised on what procedures to follow. These recommended procedures are safe and there is no additional cost to you if these procedures are needed. Rarely, long term and/or frequent use of this medication can cause scarring from the micro-injection. All of these tests are required for the Medical Provider(s) to properly and effectively diagnose and treat your complaint. Both the Vascular Diagnostic test and this application are painless and safe. The Medical Provider will then prescribe a unique treatment designed to treat the cause of your Erectile Dysfunction on the very first visit.

                                            This treatment is natural in that your own cells are used, treated with a chemical that is not foreign to the body, and injected into the specified areas. Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cell as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with a 10% to 20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of 1” in girth and length is common.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There’s actual growth of new tissue by stimulation of uni-potent stem cells, so the change in shape is not from something foreign being in the body but from the body actually rejuvenating and growing. The PRFM stimulates new blood flow with new blood vessels (neovascularization).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The results of this treatment should last 10-18 months if results mimic that seen in facial procedures, but results may vary and research documenting the longevity or results are ongoing.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A summary of possible results include: immediately larger penis, strengthening of the penis, straightening of the penis, increased circulation within the penis for a healthier organ, increase success of other therapies (if you use Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Tri-Mix these treatments will work better), an increase in sensation and pleasure (helps correct the damage from diabetes), increased size by design (can place more PRP in the base or head of the penis or where makes for best result), no allergic reactions due to using your own bodily fluids, no lumpiness, and minimal pain (no burning from the PRFM since it’s from your own body).

                                            You may take a pain medication, such as Tylenol™ or a prescription medication upon request. You may ask for an anti-anxiety medication to use prior to the treatment.

                                            A numbing lidocaine cream is applied to the penis.

                                        <p>
                                            Approximately 20cc (about 4 tablespoons) of blood are drawn in the same way blood samples are taken for routing lab tests.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The tubes of blood are centrifuged to separate the component cells. Platelets are separated and used for this procedure.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The platelets are treated with calcium chloride (which tricks the cells into thinking that they are in the body and the body has been injured). The platelets release growth factors into the liquid of the tube.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The liquid is transferred into a syringe and injected into the penis using a tiny needle and a process is used to distribute the growth factors and increase their effectiveness.

                                            The primary risks and discomforts are related to the blood draw where there is a slight pinch to insert the needle for collection and there is a potential for bruising at the site. The injections at the treatment locations can cause pain similar to an intramuscular injection (since a small needle and numbing cream are used).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There is a potential for a small bruise at the injection sites.

                                        <p>
                                            There is a risk of scarring but is minimal since regular injection of Tri-mix for years produces only about a 10% risk of scarring.
                                        </p>

                                            There may be some variation in achieving the results requested as everyone’s body type is different and may have a different response.

                                            To date, there have been no serious side effects with the use of PRP anywhere in the body. But, with or without the shot, erectile function and sensation can decrease with time.

Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cell as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with a 10% to 20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of 1” in girth and length is common.

                                            There’s actual growth of new tissue by stimulation of uni-potent stem cells, so the change in shape is not from something foreign being in the body but from the body actually rejuvenating and growing. The PRFM stimulates new blood flow with new blood vessels (neovascularization).

                                            The results of this treatment should last 10-18 months if results mimic that seen in facial procedures, but results may vary and research documenting the longevity or results are ongoing.

                                            The primary risks and discomforts are related to the blood draw where there is a slight pinch to insert the needle for collection and there is a potential for bruising at the site. The injections at the treatment locations can cause pain similar to an intramuscular injection (since a small needle and numbing cream are used).

                                            There is a risk of scarring but is minimal since regular injection of Tri-mix for years produces only about a 10% risk of scarring.

Until the introduction of shockwave therapy, all existing treatment options for erectile dysfunction are palliative in nature. This means that instead of correcting the underlying problem, existing treatments only treat symptoms on an episodic basis. Common treatments for erectile dysfunction are phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, Staxyn, and Stendra), injections and/or suppositories, and vacuum compression. Oklahoma Men’s Clinic has established a non-surgical protocol for treating erectile dysfunction with shockwave therapy and combining it with PRFM (Platelet Rich Plasma Fibrin Matrix) and Stem Cell Therapy. The therapies have shown excellent outcomes with little or no side effects and long lasting results. Shockwave therapy has also shown to be a successful treatment option for Pyrone’s disease.

                                            At Oklahoma Men’s Clinic we believe in treating the underlying issue with regenerative medicine. Shockwave therapy has been widely used in orthopedic medicine to regenerate tissue. This same therapy can be applied to treat men with erectile dysfunction. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, such as pills or injections, though effective, lose effectiveness over time and have to be used every time a man wants to engage in sexual activity. This treatment is about regenerative medicine to help men return to their younger, healthier selves and enabling a spontaneous, active sex life. The shockwaves create micro trauma to the tissue, stimulating the body’s natural healing response. As the body heals, blood flow is increased and growth factors create new blood vessels to the treated area. Shockwave therapy is combined with PRFM (Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix) and new stem cells, which adds a high concentration of growth factors to work synergistically together. The PFRM treatment is natural in that your own cells are used, treated with a chemical that is not foreign to the body and injected into the specified areas. Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cells as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with up to 10%-20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of up to 1 inch in girth and length is common.

                                            2. A numbing lidocaine cream is applied to the penis prior to the procedure.
                                            3. On the fifth treatment approximately 20cc (about 4 tablespoons) of blood are drawn in the same way blood samples are taken for routine lab tests. The tubes of blood are centrifuged to separate the component cells. Platelets are separated and used for this procedure. The platelets are treated with calcium chloride (which tricks the cells into thinking that they are in the body and the body has been injured). The platelets release growth factors into the liquid of the tube. Stem cells are then added to the PRFM. The liquid is transferred into a syringe and strategically injected into the penis using a long slim needle and this process is used to distribute the growth factors and increase their effectiveness.

                                            The primary risks and discomforts are related to the blood draw where there is a slight pinch to insert the needle for the collection and there is a potential for bruising at the site. The injections at the treatment locations cause pain similar to an intramuscular injection.

                                            There is a potential for a small bruise at the injection sites.

                                            There are virtually no risks or side effects to EPAT (Extracorporeal Pulse Activation Treatment or Shockwave Therapy) however in limited cases patients have reported minor discomfort which may continue for a few days.

                                            There may be some variation in achieving the results requested as everyone’s body type is different and may have a different response.

                                            To date there have been no serious side effects with the use of PRFM or Stem Cells anywhere in the body. But with or without the shot, erectile dysfunction and sensation can decrease with time.

                                            During your therapy you will need to use the provided pump twice per day for 10 minutes. This allows the blood flow to be drawn into the penis as though you were having an erection.
