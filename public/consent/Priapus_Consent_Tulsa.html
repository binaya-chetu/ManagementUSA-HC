                            I, ---------------------------, hereby authorize OMCT, LLC (hereafter referred to as Oklahoma Men’s Clinic located at 4415 S Harvard Suite 201, Tulsa, OK 74135) to provide medical care to me, including but not limited to the treatment of The Priapus Shot and any coexisting medical conditions. This may involve but not be limited to history taking, in-office testing, physical examination, and additional laboratory testing. This document is intended to serve as confirmation of informed consent for The Priapus Shot as ordered by Oklahoma Men’s Clinic provider.

                            <p>PURPOSE:</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Using blood-derived growth factors (platelet rich fibrin matrix [PRFM]), the Priapus Shot® is a safe procedure for enlarging and strengthening the penis.

                        </p>
                        <div class="mar-10 head subhead">
                            <p>BENEFITS:</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This treatment is natural in that your own cells are used, treated with a chemical that is not foreign to the body, and injected into the specified areas. Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cell as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with a 10% to 20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of 1” in girth and length is common.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There’s actual growth of new tissue by stimulation of uni-potent stem cells, so the change in shape is not from something foreign being in the body but from the body actually rejuvenating and growing. The PRFM stimulates new blood flow with new blood vessels (neovascularization).

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The results of this treatment should last 10-18 months if results mimic that seen in facial procedures, but results may vary and research documenting the longevity or results are ongoing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A summary of possible results include: immediately larger penis, strengthening of the penis, straightening of the penis, increased circulation within the penis for a healthier organ, increase success of other therapies (if you use Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Tri-Mix these treatments will work better), an increase in sensation and pleasure (helps correct the damage from diabetes), increased size by design (can place more PRP in the base or head of the penis or where makes for best result), no allergic reactions due to using your own bodily fluids, no lumpiness, and minimal pain (no burning from the PRFM since it’s from your own body).

                        </p>
                        <div class="mar-10 head subhead">
                            <p>TREATMENT</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            You may take a pain medication, such as Tylenol™ or a prescription medication upon request. You may ask for an anti-anxiety medication to use prior to the treatment.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A numbing lidocaine cream is applied to the penis.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Approximately 20cc (about 4 tablespoons) of blood are drawn in the same way blood samples are taken for routing lab tests.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tubes of blood are centrifuged to separate the component cells. Platelets are separated and used for this procedure.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The platelets are treated with calcium chloride (which tricks the cells into thinking that they are in the body and the body has been injured). The platelets release growth factors into the liquid of the tube.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The liquid is transferred into a syringe and injected into the penis using a tiny needle and a process is used to distribute the growth factors and increase their effectiveness.

                        </p>

                            <p>FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The primary risks and discomforts are related to the blood draw where there is a slight pinch to insert the needle for collection and there is a potential for bruising at the site. The injections at the treatment locations can cause pain similar to an intramuscular injection (since a small needle and numbing cream are used).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is a potential for a small bruise at the injection sites.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is a risk of scarring but is minimal since regular injection of Tri-mix for years produces only about a 10% risk of scarring.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smokers have less positive response to this treatment than non-smokers.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be some variation in achieving the results requested as everyone’s body type is different and may have a different response.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To date, there have been no serious side effects with the use of PRP anywhere in the body. But, with or without the shot, erectile function and sensation can decrease with time.
