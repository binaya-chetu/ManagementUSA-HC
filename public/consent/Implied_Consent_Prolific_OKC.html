This may involve but not be limited to history taking, in-office testing, physical examination, and additional laboratory testing. This document is intended to serve as confirmation of informed consent to Prolific Shockwave Therapy as ordered by the Oklahoma Men’s Clinic provider.

                            <p>PURPOSE</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Using Shockwaves in strategic locations of the penis and then injecting PFRM with Stem Cells. Until the introduction of shockwave therapy, all existing treatment options for erectile dysfunction are palliative in nature. This means that instead of correcting the underlying problem, existing treatments only treat symptoms on an episodic basis. Common treatments for erectile dysfunction are phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, Staxyn, and Stendra), injections and/or suppositories, and vacuum compression. Oklahoma Men’s Clinic has established a non-surgical protocol for treating erectile dysfunction with shockwave therapy and combining it with PRFM (Platelet Rich Plasma Fibrin Matrix) and Stem Cell Therapy. The therapies have shown excellent outcomes with little or no side effects and long lasting results. Shockwave therapy has also shown to be a successful treatment option for Pyrone’s disease.

                            <p>BENEFITS</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            At Oklahoma Men’s Clinic we believe in treating the underlying issue with regenerative medicine. Shockwave therapy has been widely used in orthopedic medicine to regenerate tissue. This same therapy can be applied to treat men with erectile dysfunction. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, such as pills or injections, though effective, lose effectiveness over time and have to be used every time a man wants to engage in sexual activity. This treatment is about regenerative medicine to help men return to their younger, healthier selves and enabling a spontaneous, active sex life. The shockwaves create micro trauma to the tissue, stimulating the body’s natural healing response. As the body heals, blood flow is increased and growth factors create new blood vessels to the treated area. Shockwave therapy is combined with PRFM (Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix) and new stem cells, which adds a high concentration of growth factors to work synergistically together. The PFRM treatment is natural in that your own cells are used, treated with a chemical that is not foreign to the body and injected into the specified areas. Since a distillate of growth factors from your own blood (PRFM) is used there should be no side effects from the material injected. The body reacts to the treated cells as it does to a wound and immediately starts repairing the tissue. This builds the underlying tissue with up to 10%-20% increase in length and girth. You should see improvements immediately, although there is usually a return to prior treatment status in 3-5 days as the water is absorbed and prior to the complete action of the fibroblasts to increase the size of the penis. Within 2-4 weeks an increase of up to 1 inch in girth and length is common.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There’s actual growth of new tissue by stimulation of uni-potent stem cells including the new stem cells which were injected, so the change in shape is not from something foreign being in the body but from the body actually rejuvenating and growing. The PRFM stimulates new blood flow with the new blood vessels (neovascularization).

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The results of this treatment should be indefinite based on the individual and his lifestyle choices but results may vary and research documenting the longevity or results are ongoing.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A summary of possible results includes: immediately larger penis; strengthening of the penis, straightening of the penis, increased circulation within the penis for a healthier organ, increased effectiveness of other therapies (if you use Viagra, Cialis, etc it will work better for you), an increase in sensation and pleasure (helps correct the damage from diabetes), increased size by design (can place more in the base or in the head or wherever makes for best result), no allergic reactions (due to using your won bodily fluids), no lumpiness, and minimal pain (no burning from the PRFM since it’s from your own body).

                        </p>

                            <p>TREATMENT</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            1. A series of 6 shockwaves (EPAT) treatments are administered (Two per week for 3 consecutive weeks).
                            2. A numbing lidocaine cream is applied to the penis prior to the procedure.
                            3. On the fifth treatment approximately 20cc (about 4 tablespoons) of blood are drawn in the same way blood samples are taken for routine lab tests. The tubes of blood are centrifuged to separate the component cells. Platelets are separated and used for this procedure. The platelets are treated with calcium chloride (which tricks the cells into thinking that they are in the body and the body has been injured). The platelets release growth factors into the liquid of the tube. Stem cells are then added to the PRFM. The liquid is transferred into a syringe and strategically injected into the penis using a long slim needle and this process is used to distribute the growth factors and increase their effectiveness.

                            <p>FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The primary risks and discomforts are related to the blood draw where there is a slight pinch to insert the needle for the collection and there is a potential for bruising at the site. The injections at the treatment locations cause pain similar to an intramuscular injection.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is a potential for a small bruise at the injection sites.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are virtually no risks or side effects to EPAT (Extracorporeal Pulse Activation Treatment or Shockwave Therapy) however in limited cases patients have reported minor discomfort which may continue for a few days.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be some variation in achieving the results requested as everyone’s body type is different and may have a different response.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To date there have been no serious side effects with the use of PRFM or Stem Cells anywhere in the body. But with or without the shot, erectile dysfunction and sensation can decrease with time.

                            During your therapy you will need to use the provided pump twice per day for 10 minutes. This allows the blood flow to be drawn into the penis as though you were having an erection.
