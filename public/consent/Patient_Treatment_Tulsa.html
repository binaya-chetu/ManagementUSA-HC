							You will be seen in a private examination room where you will be attended to by an Oklahoma State Licensed Provider or Physician (“Medical Provider”) who will examine you, check your general medical condition, ask about any medications you are presently taking, and discuss with you the specific problem for which you have come to the medical clinic. Soon after you will be given a diagnostic dose of medication or review of your symptoms in which your response will inform our Medical Provider what solution best meets your needs.

							The undersigned Patient (“Patient”) authorizes and instructs OMCT, LLC (“Oklahoma Men’s Clinic”) to provide the Patient with medical management, administrative and Erectile Dysfunction, Testosterone/HGH Therapy. Patient acknowledges and agrees to the following terms and conditions contained in this Patient Authorization Agreement (“Agreement”). Patient submits with this Agreement an accurately completed Medical History Form (“MHF”). Patient agrees to respond truthfully, accurately, and completely on the MHF and acknowledges that failure to provide truthful, accurate, and complete information on the MHF or to the Medical Provider(s) at Oklahoma Men’s Clinic (“Provider”) could result in inappropriate treatment. Patient authorizes Oklahoma Men’s Clinic to receive copies of reports from medical laboratories, diagnostic testing services and dispensing pharmacies relating to his/her treatment. In addition, patient authorizes and instructs Oklahoma Men’s Clinic, Medical Provider(s) and dispensing pharmacies obtained on my behalf to provide medical care and prescribed pharmaceuticals based on the information contained on the MHF, laboratory diagnostic tests, and other information submitted to Oklahoma Men’s Clinic under the Agreement.

							<strong>Erectile Dysfunction & Premature Ejaculation:</strong> The Medical Provider(s) will perform some diagnostic tests. The first test is a Vascular Doppler Diagnostic. This test measures the blood flow through the penis. The doctor will locate the cavernosal artery in the penis and measure “passive” blood flow (when you are not sexually excited). The Medical Provider will then apply a test dose of medication designed for your specific problem to the spongy tissue of the penis using an auto-applicator. The test dose of medication contains a combination of commonly use vasodilators including Papaverine, Phentolamine and Prostaglandin E1. This medication will dilate the arteries so that the “active” blood flow (as when you are sexually excited) through the penis can be measured. A partial or full erection lasting 40-60 minutes usually results from this application. Other rare effects of this procedure include some mild discomfort or light-headedness mostly due to nervousness. This reaction is generally normal. Rarely, this application may produce a full erection lasting longer than two hours. Such prolonged erection is unusual and only occurs in those who are overly sensitive to the combination used. Should this possibility occur, you will be advised on what procedures to follow. These recommended procedures are safe and there is no additional cost to you if these procedures are needed. Rarely, long term and/or frequent use of this medication can cause scarring from the micro-injection. All of these tests are required for the Medical Provider(s) to properly and effectively diagnose and treat your complaint. Both the Vascular Diagnostic test and this application are painless and safe. The Medical Provider will then prescribe a unique treatment designed to treat the cause of your Erectile Dysfunction on the very first visit.
