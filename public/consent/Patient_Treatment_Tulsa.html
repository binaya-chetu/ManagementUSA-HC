                            <strong>Erectile Dysfunction & Premature Ejaculation:</strong> The Medical Provider(s) will perform some diagnostic tests. The first test is a Vascular Doppler Diagnostic. This test measures the blood flow through the penis. The doctor will locate the cavernosal artery in the penis and measure “passive” blood flow (when you are not sexually excited). The Medical Provider will then apply a test dose of medication designed for your specific problem to the spongy tissue of the penis using an auto-applicator. The test dose of medication contains a combination of commonly use vasodilators including Papaverine, Phentolamine and Prostaglandin E1. This medication will dilate the arteries so that the “active” blood flow (as when you are sexually excited) through the penis can be measured. A partial or full erection lasting 40-60 minutes usually results from this application. Other rare effects of this procedure include some mild discomfort or light-headedness mostly due to nervousness. This reaction is generally normal. Rarely, this application may produce a full erection lasting longer than two hours. Such prolonged erection is unusual and only occurs in those who are overly sensitive to the combination used. Should this possibility occur, you will be advised on what procedures to follow. These recommended procedures are safe and there is no additional cost to you if these procedures are needed. Rarely, long term and/or frequent use of this medication can cause scarring from the micro-injection. All of these tests are required for the Medical Provider(s) to properly and effectively diagnose and treat your complaint. Both the Vascular Diagnostic test and this application are painless and safe. The Medical Provider will then prescribe a unique treatment designed to treat the cause of your Erectile Dysfunction on the very first visit.
