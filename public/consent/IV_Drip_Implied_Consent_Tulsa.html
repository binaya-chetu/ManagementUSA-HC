                            I, ---------------------------, hereby authorize OMCT, LLC (hereafter referred to as Oklahoma Men’s Clinic located at 4415 S. Harvard Ave. Tulsa OK 74135) to provide medical care to me, including but not limited to the treatment of a vitamin deficiency and any coexisting medical conditions. This may involve but not be limited to history taking, in-office testing, physical examination, and additional laboratory testing. This document is intended to serve as confirmation of informed consent for IV therapy and/or chelation as ordered by an Oklahoma Men’s Clinic provider.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            --------------------------- Initial I have informed the provider of any known allergies to drugs or other substances that may be included in the ingredients of my solutions, or of any past reactions to anesthetics.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            --------------------------- Initial I have informed the provider of all current medications and supplements.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I understand that I have the right to be informed during the procedure, the risks, and the benefits. Except in emergencies, procedures are not performed until I have had an opportunity to receive such information and to give my informed consent.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The intravenous (IV) procedure involves inserting a needle into your vein and infusing over a determined period of time, prescribed nutrients (vitamins, minerals, amino acids) or chelation agents. Chelating agents may be infused for pretreatment testing. Chelation testing helps your physician to develop a chelation treatment plan.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I understand that risks, benefits, and alternative to IV’s or IV/Oral Chelation may include but are not limited to:

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            1. Risks and Potential Side Effects:
                            o Discomfort, bruising, and pain at the site of the injection
                            o Inflammation of the vein used for injection, phlebitis, metabolic disturbances, and injury
                            o Severe reaction, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, or death
                            2. Benefits
                            o Injectables are not affected by stomach or intestinal disease
                            o Total amount of infusion enters the bloodstream and is available to the tissues
                            o Higher doses of nutrients can be given by vein than by mouth without intestinal irritation that can accompany does given by mouth
                            o IV chelation therapy helps to reduce and eliminate heavy metals

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            3. Alternatives to intravenous vitamin therapy are oral supplementation and/or dietary and lifestyle changes. Alternative therapies to intravenous chelation are oral chelation therapy or therapies to improve the natural elimination of metal compounds through nutritional supplementation and tissue cleansing such as constitutional hydrotherapy and colon hydrotherapy.

                        </p>
